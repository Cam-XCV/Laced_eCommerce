# Laced_eCommerce

An eCommerce app built in React for a shop specialising in trainers. The app includes functionality for users: allowing them to login, manage their profile, view order history, and complete purchases with card transactions. There is also an admin login which allows modification of products and cancellation of user orders.

This was a group project, worked on with Craig Alexander and Cyril Ishabiyi.
